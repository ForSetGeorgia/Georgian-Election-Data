        help_1: "The same set of shape records can be shared with multiple events. When you delete shapes for the selected Event, you will also be deleting shapes for other Events that use the same set of shape records. "
        help_2: "For the selected shape level, all shapes at that level and subsequent shape levels that are under the selected level will be deleted.  For instance, if you select 'District', all 'District' shapes will be deleted as well as all 'Precinct' shapes that are under those 'District' shapes."
